## 🚀 How to Use This Repo

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/niranjan-pcps/data-science-with-ai-2025.git
   cd data-science-with-ai-2025/
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**
   - On windows (Use command prompt on vscode not powershell for activation)
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   venv\Scripts\activate

   ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
      ```

3. Install required packages
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. For vscode, activate the kernel using select kernel and then to python environments and to .venv
  

# 🙋‍♂️ Notes for Students
- Fork the repo or download individual files to practice.

- Try modifying the code to deepen your understanding.

- If you encounter any confusion or bugs, feel free to raise an issue or ask during class.

- Bonus exercises and datasets may be added for self-practice.
